# RL_PROJECT_HIGHWAY_INTERSECTION

We are simulating the https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env Highwayay and Intersection environment. <br /> 
We are attempting to make our agent learn good policies via Deep Reinforceent Learning. The agent must avoid collision with other Human Drivers and maintain a high speed on the highway environment.We also have a multi agent implementation on the Intersection environment.
